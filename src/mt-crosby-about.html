      <h2>About the Society</h2>

      <p>
        The Mount Crosby Historical Society is a not-for-profit organisation formed and incorporated in the state of Queensland in 2001 with the objective to research, preserve and promote the history and heritage of the Mount Crosby district. A former Mount Crosby Historical Society created through the efforts of four gentlemen (Ray Rogan, Rob Swenson, Glen McDougall and Geoff Coussins) was active in the 1980s and must be credited with the original idea to form a society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their inspirational efforts were motivated by the observation made by both groups; that valuable information about Mount Crosby's rich history and the lessons it holds for us were at risk of being lost or misinterpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today's Mount Crosby Historical Society has focussed on the collection, review and interpretation of primary documentation (including photographs, plans, letters, reports, newspaper articles &c.) to create a strong understanding and narrative of our district's development. In this regard, it should be mentioned that Mount Crosby has a rich history with a sensational number of quality records capable of illustrating its rural, social and engineering heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To advance its charter, the Society directs its public efforts toward activities that engage and enlighten its audience, including the publication of weekly (Did You Know?) and monthly (Penned in the Past) articles, hosting heritage walking tours, providing presentations and photographic exhibitions and in general attempting to answer any enquiries that arise. The current executive committee of the Society is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>President - Colin Hester</li>
        <li>Secretary - Robert Suhr</li>
        <li>Treasurer - Stacey Hester</li>
        <li>Historian - Judith Nissen</li>
        <li>Committee Member - Kristy Howard</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is the particular wish of the Society that its efforts be welcoming to residents new and old, and that its stories help everyone to embrace being a resident of Mount Crosby or part of our large Diaspora.
      </p>
