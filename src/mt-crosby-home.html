      <h2>Welcome to Mt Crosby History</h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          “I ascended a lofty conical hill about four miles north from the tent, having a rocky summit, from which I expected an extensive prospect. My expectations were not disappointed. A more magnificent view it has not often fallen to my lot to behold.”
        </i><br>
        <b>John Oxley, Wednesday 22 September 1824</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        And that was the recorded start of things … the start of recorded things … in the district of Mount Crosby. It might have developed the way of other rural neighbourhoods, except for its natural advantage as a source for water supply. From the late 1880s, this added an amazing engineering dimension to the district’s rural and social themes.

        <i>
          “For there is quite a little town here … its calico structures dotting the hillside at every eligible spot … in the midst of which the great brick chimney stack of the boiler-house rears its lofty head to a height of 130ft. above the ground.”
        </i><br>
        <b>The Queenslander, Saturday 12 December 1891</b>
      </p>

        To the student of history, the visitor, and the happy person whose recreation it is to ponder local mysteries, we are delighted to say Mount Crosby’s story is rich and different. It is fortunate that the forces that shaped Mount Crosby also encouraged the keeping of records and the capture of images. Each of them is a sample of an earlier experience, upon which we can all build an understanding of our district’s development. We hope everyone enjoys this website as a portal into our local history. The subjects are striking in their diversity – enough amazing stories to fill an archive.
      </p>
